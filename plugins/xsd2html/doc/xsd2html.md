# XSD Documentation

<mark>Currently unsupported</mark>

For an XML schema that you wish to document, the build tools have automated flows for generating XSD
schema specifications in a standard documentation template.

To embed documentation, implement code such as this:

`xsd2html("assets\simple_schema.xsd", "Simple Schema")`

The resulting code is a simple pointer to the documentation as well as a pointer to the original
source file for the schema.

FIXME

`xsd2html("assets\simple_schema.xsd", "Simple Schema")
`
